A python script, intended for Eve Online, that adds all the members of a corporation or alliance to your characters in-game watchlist. It accomplishes this by going through Eve Gate, meaning you can play the game while adding contacts!


How it Works:

1. Log in using the same credentials you use to log into Eve Gate. Be sure you have already logged into Eve Gate and selected your intended character at least once on the computer you are running the script.
2. Select if you are adding either a corporation, or an alliance.
3. Enter the name of the corporation or the alliance, and hit the Add button.
4. The script will pull all the members of the corp using the Eve Who api, and will add them to your characters neutral standing. BE SURE YOU NETURAL STANDING TAB IS EMPTY BEFORE THIS. It then add a label that is the same as the corp/alliance name to all members in your neutral standings, and then move everyone to your terrible standing.
5. Once this is done, you will be able to enter another corp/alliance until you have added everyone you need.
6. Once you have added everyone you wish, re-log your eve client, and your watchlist should update automatically.
